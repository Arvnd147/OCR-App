# OCR-App
A simple image to text conversion application using OCR.

I've used Google's open-source library - pytesseract for OCR and python-Flask framework for server side scripting.

The web application consists of two webpages.
After uploading the required image in the first page,
it will redirect to the result page which displays the extracted text from the image.

Demo images: (the sample image can be found in the static/images/sample.png path)
